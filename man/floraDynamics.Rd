\description{
Models plant growth from field data in a series of models,
selecting the best model and providing error statistics.
}
\details{
Input table requires the following fields:
Point - numbered point in a transect
Species - name of the surveyed Species
Age - age of the site since the triggering disturbance

Species that are less common than the set threshold are combined as "Minor Species"
}
